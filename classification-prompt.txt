Based on the following listing details and the type of housing they are looking for, make a short and concise assessment (up to 100 words) of whether this ad suits them. Mention why it does and why it doesn't. Also mention contradictions or things that need clarification.

Also based on what they are looking for provide a matching percentage in a format like:
Matching: X%
The matching percentage should follow the rule: at least 50% if it matches everything they need and don't want, less than 50% if it doesn't match everything they need/want or who they are, and then up to 100% based on what they prefer or who they are.

Your answer should consist of 2 lines. One with the assessment. One with the matching percentage.
If a need or preference is not directly mentioned don't assume, instead mention it in the assessment.
